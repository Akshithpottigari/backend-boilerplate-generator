# Backend Template Generator


Pretty simple and straight forward setup.

This package creates a boilerplate code which in turn, reduces the time in setting up any Express Server which requires TypeScript, JWT and Authorization.
## Installation

Install Backend Template Generator with npm:

```bash
  $ npm i btg
```

Run the application:
```bash
  $ npm run start
```
